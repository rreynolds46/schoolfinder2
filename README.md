# SchoolFinder

> Enable High School students to quickly find and connect with schools. Create a profile to allow schools to find out more information about you in a way the Common Application / General Application is incapable of. Look for schools that meet your ideal campus, size, and culture then quickly connect with the admissions team to determine fit.
